# Project: Live Band
A platform where music fans are able to connect with individuals with similar musical tastes and keep up to date to upcoming concerts and events. Bands also are able to upload information and posts about their accouncements including upcoming concerts, music, and other live performances. 

In the first iteration of the code, I have the user input their information to make an account including account type, name, username, and password. The user will then see the information they input at the end after they complete account creation. 

What I need to do: 
- Use the account class to create an account or make any changes to the user's account. Get the scanners into the class instead of in the main
- Allow business/band accounts to create dates for events and upcoming shows
- Ask users for their music genres and interests
